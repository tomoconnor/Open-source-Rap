Whether twitter or on facebook,
listen up now if you please,
'cos this rap when on second look,
is not of drugs and slease.

For open source is the concept here,
A concept of sharing and a concept of free,
A concept that does scare Windows more so by the year,
But one that fills a Linux fan with happiness and glee.

Whether browsing on the net,
Or models to be raised,
You really shouldn't fret,
There's money there to save.

As open source does prove,
To companies at top,
That progress makes us move,
And money makes us stop.

So if you care to even,
The progress of our race,
Put down your Windows Seven,
Let Linux be the case!
