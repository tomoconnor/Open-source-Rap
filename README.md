Open-source Rap.
================

I was at Google OSJam last night (Thursday 28th July 2011), and somebody mentioned something peripherally related to rap music.  

There are many different types of open-source expression.  
Here's a few examples: 

* [open-source beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Beer_Project)

* [open-source cola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCola_(drink\))

* [open-source hardware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware)

* plenty of open-source software that we all know and love.

Rap music, and beat poetry are pretty fantastic forms of personal expression.  I want to see whether we can build a community of rap / hip-hop musicians with a passion for open-source music and creativity.
